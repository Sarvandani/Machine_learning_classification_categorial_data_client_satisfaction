# Machine_learning_classification_categorial_data_client_satisfaction

This project demonstrates multi-class classification on customer satisfaction survey data, using categorical and ordinal features.

It trains and compares four machine learning algorithms:

✅ Naive Bayes (CategoricalNB)

✅ Decision Tree

✅ Random Forest

✅ k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Finally, it selects the best performing model automatically and provides an interactive predictor that allows users to enter new customer survey responses and receive a satisfaction level prediction.
